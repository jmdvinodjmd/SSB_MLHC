# Usage:
1. *Install* all the required libraries
2. *Prepare data* by running '1_DGP.ipynb' notebook. Please download the raw files for Covid and Diabetes datasets (links are provided in notebook).
3. *Run the code* by simply running notebooks starting with *2* as those refer to different methods as indicated by their names. You can run all the experiments at once by running the script *run_notebooks.sh*. The results will be stored in Excel files for each method.
4. *Plot results* by running noteboks starting with *3*.
